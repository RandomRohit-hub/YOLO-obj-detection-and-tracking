# YOLO Object Detection and Tracking

This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using the YOLOv4 algorithm combined with OpenCV. It processes video inputs to detect and track objects frame-by-frame, providing a foundation for applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, and more.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

* `app(bassics).py` ‚Äì Entry point for running the application.
* `object_detection.py` ‚Äì Contains functions for object detection using YOLOv4.
* `object_tracking.py` ‚Äì Implements object tracking logic.
* `classes.txt` ‚Äì List of object classes that the model can detect.
* `yolov4.cfg` ‚Äì YOLOv4 configuration file.
* `los_angeles.mp4` ‚Äì Sample video file for testing.
* `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Python dependencies required to run the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RandomRohit-hub/YOLO-obj-detection-and-tracking.git
   cd YOLO-obj-detection-and-tracking
   ```



2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



3. **Download YOLOv4 weights:**

   Download the pre-trained YOLOv4 weights from the official source and place them in the project directory.

   ```bash
   wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov4.weights
   ```



## üß™ Usage

Run the application using the sample video:

```bash
python app(bassics).py
```



This will process `los_angeles.mp4`, performing object detection and tracking on the video frames.

## üìù Notes

* Ensure that the `yolov4.weights`, `yolov4.cfg`, and `classes.txt` files are present in the project directory.
* Modify `app(bassics).py` to change the input video or adjust detection parameters as needed.
